## Description
This project is the first milestone from the "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge, combining skills from the first three projects.

This app is a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, but with a twist. The game displays the computer's move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and then randomly challenges the user to either **Win** or **Lose** against that move. The user must select the correct move that satisfies the condition.
## Challenges
This milestone project required implementing the following features:

1.  Create a game app that plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
2.  Randomly challenge the player to either **win** or **lose** the round, with the condition changing each turn.
3.  Track the player's score. Add 1 point for a correct answer (fulfilling the win/lose condition) and subtract 1 point for a wrong answer (the score cannot go below 0).
4.  The game must end after 10 rounds.
5.  When the game ends, display an alert showing the user's final score.
6.  Include a "Play Again" button in the alert to reset the game to its initial state.

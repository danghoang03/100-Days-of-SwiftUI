# Project 2 - Guess the Flag
## Topics
Stacks (VStack, ZStack), Buttons, Images, @State, Alerts, Gradients
## Description
This is Project 2 from the "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/20)
This project is a simple "Guess the Flag" game. The goal is to build fundamental skills in layout, user interaction, and state management. The user is shown three flags and must choose the correct flag for the requested country.

The app uses @State to track the flags currently being shown, the correct answer, the user's score, and the state of various alerts.
## Challenges
1. Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert and in the score label.
2. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
3. Make the game show only 8 questions, at which point they see a final alert judging their score and can restart the game.

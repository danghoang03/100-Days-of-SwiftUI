# Project 8 - Moonshot

## Topics
ScrollView, Navigation, Codable & JSON, Grid, Generics, DateFormatter.

## Description
This is Project 8 from the "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/39).

This project is a space exploration application that displays detailed information about NASA's Apollo missions. The goal is to build skills in using ScrollView, NavigationStack, complex layouts with grids, and decoding JSON data using Generics.

The app loads data from local JSON files to show a list of missions. Users can select a mission to view its details, including the launch date, description, and crew members. Tapping on a crew member reveals their specific astronaut details.

## Challenges
1. Add the launch date to `MissionView`, below the mission badge.
2. Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in `MissionView` (`CrewScrollView`) and the custom divider (`CustomDivider`) were extracted.
3. Add a toolbar item to `ContentView` that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list.

## Demo
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="demo.gif" width="300px"/>
</div>

# Project 12 - SwiftData

## Topics
SwiftData, @Model, @Query, SortDescriptor, Predicate, ModelContext

## Description
This is Project 12 from the "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/59).

In this project, we return to Project 7 (iExpense) to upgrade its data persistence layer. Instead of using `UserDefaults` and `Codable`, the app is refactored to use **SwiftData** for more robust and efficient local storage. The project focuses on creating models, querying data, and dynamically sorting/filtering results.

## Challenges
1. Start by upgrading the app to use SwiftData.
2. Add a customizable sort order option: by name or by amount.
3. Add a filter option to show all expenses, just personal expenses, or just business expenses.

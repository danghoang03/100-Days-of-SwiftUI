# Project 4 - BetterRest
## Topics
DatePicker, Stepper, CoreML, DateComponents, DateFormatter
## Description
This is Project 4 from the "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/26).

This project is an app called "BetterRest" designed to help users find their ideal bedtime. It uses a pre-trained CoreML model (SleepCalculator.mlmodel) to predict the optimal bedtime based on three user inputs:

- When they want to wake up.

- Their desired amount of sleep.

- How many cups of coffee they drink per day.
## Challenges
1. Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. 
2. Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.
3. Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.

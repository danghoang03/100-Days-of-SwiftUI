# Project 1 - WeSplit
## Topics
@State, @FocusState, Form, Section, TextField, Picker, NavigationStack, Computed Properties, Toolbar, Keyboard Handling
## Description
This is Project 1 from the "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16).

This project is a tip calculator application named "WeSplit." The goal is to build an interactive Form that gathers user input and performs basic calculations.

The app allows the user to enter a check amount, select the number of people, and choose a tip percentage. It then automatically calculates the total amount (including the tip) and the amount per person. This project uses @State to track input values and @FocusState to manage the keyboard's visibility.
## Challenges
1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
3. Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%.

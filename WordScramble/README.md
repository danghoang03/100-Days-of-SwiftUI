# Project 5 - WordScramble
## Topics
List, Bundle (File Loading), UITextChecker, onAppear, onSubmit, String manipulation
## Description
This is Project 5 from the "100 Days of SwiftUI" challenge (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/29).

This project is a classic anagram game. The app loads a random word from a text file in the app bundle, and the player must create as many new words as possible using the letters from that root word.
## Challenges
1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
